## Key Learnings (From AGENTS.md)

### Resource Management
- Always `defer Close()` on resources immediately after acquisition
- Pattern: acquire, defer close, check error, use

### Stream Handling
- Cache stream data on first read to enable multiple accesses
- Document whether APIs return parsed data or strings

### Context Cancellation
- ALL blocking operations must check context
- Use `select` with `ctx.Done()` for I/O operations
- Check `ctx.Err()` periodically in CPU-bound loops

### Thread-Local Storage
- Required for plugins that modify their own state
- Document which plugins need it and why
- Consider helper functions to reduce boilerplate
